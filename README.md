👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a full-stack developer in training at kood/Sisu, a 24-month, peer-to-peer coding program focused on practical, project-based learning. My academic background includes a PhD in the field of metabolomics, systems biology, and mass spectrometry.

🌱 I’m currently working with Golang, JavaScript, and Python, building production-style applications both independently and in teams. 

🚀 Featured Project: Ella’s Corner
A server-rendered Go web application for sharing community-sourced baby product recommendations. Originally built as a book discussion forum using only the Go standard library, it was reimagined into a more user-centered platform with:

- User authentication, item filtering, and profile management

- Secure session handling, image upload, and donation indicators

- Minimal JavaScript enhancements for UX

- SQLite backend and Dockerized deployment

- Unit and integration tests using Go’s testing framework

🤝 Open to Opportunities
I like to take part in collaborative projects where I can continue growing my technical skills and contribute to meaningful solutions especially in science, healthcare, or AI.
