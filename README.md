- 👀 I’m studying to be a full stack developer at kood/Sisu coding school and my background is in metabolomics, systems biology and mass spectrometry (PhD). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang, JavaScript and Python by building programmes in collaboration with other students and by myself. I have a keen interest in bioinformatics, AI and data analytics.
- 💞️ I welcome opportunities and projects that will help me develop my skills - at kood/Sisu I will develop them to a professional level over 24 months.
- 📫 You can reach me at merja.rossi@gmail.com
